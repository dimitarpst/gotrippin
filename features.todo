Todo:
  ☐ Maps integration — Mapbox + coordinates (docs/MAPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
  ☐ Route screen — map-first layout with bottom sheet editor (docs/MAPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md, docs/route-based-trip-planning-architecture.md)
    ✔ Phase 1 — Map + bottom sheet scaffolding (read-only route; no editing)
    ✔ Phase 2 — Edit existing stops in sheet (reorder, rename, dates) synced to map
    ☐ Phase 3 — Add stops via search (Google Places) and map click
    ☐ Phase 4 — Draggable markers, map interactions polish, animations
    ☐ Phase 5 — Align Create Trip route step with map-first route editor (shared RouteEditor UX)
  ✔ Map UX research — dynamic markers, popups, clicks & draggable markers via react-map-gl / Mapbox docs (Context7)
