🌍 Go Trippin'

Explore. Connect. Go Trippin'.
A modern travel companion that helps you plan, organize, and share your trips — from the first idea to the final photo.

✨ Overview

Go Trippin' is a cross-platform travel planner built to make trip creation simple, visual, and collaborative.
It's designed for explorers, digital nomads, and friend groups who want an effortless way to plan journeys together — without the chaos of group chats and scattered notes.

🔗 Shareable Trip URLs

Trips use short share codes (8 alphanumeric characters) instead of UUIDs for clean, shareable URLs:
- URL format: `/trips/{shareCode}` (e.g., `/trips/AbC123Xy`)
- Share codes are automatically generated when creating trips
- Each trip has a unique share code that can be used to access the trip
- Security: Access is still controlled via RLS - users must be trip members to view/edit

🎯 Purpose

The purpose of Go Trippin’ is to redefine how people plan and experience travel by turning trip organization into an intuitive, shared experience.
Instead of juggling spreadsheets and screenshots, users can:

📅 Create trips — define destinations, dates, and themes in a few taps.

🧭 Add activities — flights, accommodations, restaurants, and custom events.

🪄 Customize trip visuals — select backgrounds or upload photos for each trip.

👥 Collaborate with others — share trips, vote on plans, and sync updates in real-time.

🗂️ Keep memories organized — store itineraries, photos, and trip details in one place.

Go Trippin’ blends structure and creativity — offering a travel planning experience that’s as aesthetic as it is functional.
