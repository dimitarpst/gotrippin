---

## 🔑 Phase 1 — Backend Foundation

1. **Initialize NestJS app**
   - Create `/apps/backend/src/main.ts` and base structure.
   - Add modules: `auth`, `profiles`, `trips`, `ai` (placeholder).
   - Install dependencies: `@nestjs/config`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `zod`, `class-validator`, `swagger`.

2. **Supabase Admin Integration**
   - Configure `.env` with `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
   - Implement Supabase Admin Client provider and export via DI.

3. **Auth Module**
   - Validate Supabase JWT.
   - Create `JwtAuthGuard` to protect routes.

4. **Profiles Module**
   - `GET /profiles/:id`, `PUT /profiles/:id`.
   - Sync with existing frontend profile fields (`display_name`, `phone`, `avatar_color`).

5. **Trips Module**
   - CRUD endpoints: `GET /trips/:userId`, `POST /trips`, `PUT /trips/:id`, `DELETE /trips/:id`.
   - Use DTOs + Zod validation.

---

## 🧩 Phase 2 — Shared Schemas & Types ✅ **COMPLETED**

1. ✅ Created `packages/core/`:
   - `/schemas/profile.ts` — Zod schema for profile with validation
   - `/schemas/trip.ts` — Zod schema for trip with date validation
   - `/types/index.ts` — shared TypeScript interfaces
   - `/index.ts` — centralized exports

2. ✅ Backend Integration:
   - DTOs created using shared schemas
   - Controllers updated with validation
   - Type-safe request/response handling

3. ✅ Frontend Integration:
   - Validation utilities created (`src/lib/validation.ts`)
   - Custom hooks for form validation (`src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts`)
   - Example components demonstrating usage

4. ✅ Both apps now reference `@gotrippin/core` as dependency

---

## 🗄️ Phase 3 — Trips Database Setup ✅ **COMPLETED**

### ✅ Details:

1. ✅ Implemented many-to-many trips using a bridge table (`public.trip_members`).
2. ✅ Configured all necessary RLS policies for `public.trips` and `public.trip_members` to ensure collaborative, secure access.
3. ✅ Updated backend API (Supabase Service, Trips Service, Trips Controller) to work with the new schema, including member management endpoints.
4. ✅ Updated Zod schemas in `packages/core` to reflect the many-to-many structure.
5. 🗑️ Old SQL migration files were removed as per request.

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Trip Management Frontend ✅ **COMPLETED**

1. ✅ Connect existing UI components to backend endpoints:
   - ✅ `trips-list.tsx` → fetch user trips with loading states
   - ✅ `create-trip.tsx` → call `POST /trips` with validation
   - ✅ `trip-overview.tsx` → fetch + edit trip
2. ✅ Add:
   - ✅ Form validation (Zod frontend)
   - ✅ Proper loading / error states
   - ✅ Auth guards (Supabase session)
3. ✅ Image selection via Unsplash API (replaces upload for now)
4. ✅ Core Trip Management:
   - ✅ **Edit trip functionality** - full update form with pre-populated data
   - ✅ **Trip deletion with confirmation** - delete button + confirmation dialog
   - ✅ **Trip image display** - images show correctly in cards and overview
   - ✅ **Shareable URLs** - trips use share codes instead of UUIDs for clean URLs
5. 🚧 Remaining for Future:
   - [ ] Trip member management UI (invite/manage collaborators)
   - [ ] Share trip functionality (copy share code link to clipboard)

---

## ⚡ Phase 5 — Enhancements & Realtime

1. Add Supabase Realtime listeners for live trip updates.
2. Implement collaborative editing for shared trips.
3. Add background uploads / file management.

---

## 🤖 Phase 6 — AI Dream Vacation Recommendations (Future)

1. Develop a frontend screen where users describe their dream vacation through AI-guided questions.
2. Store user interests and preferences in the database.
3. In the backend `ai` module:
   - Integrate OpenAI API to process user input.
   - Implement an endpoint (e.g., `POST /ai/dream-vacation`) to generate personalized vacation recommendations based on stored interests.
4. Display AI-recommended vacations to the user.

---

## 🧱 Phase 7 — Testing & Deployment

1. Add E2E tests (NestJS + Playwright).
2. Configure Vercel (web) + Render (API).
3. Add CI pipeline for lint/typecheck.
4. Deploy production environment.

---

## 🔄 Workflow for Agents

- Always read `AGENTS.md` + `docs/next_steps.md` before new tasks.
- For multi-file changes: use **Plan Mode** first.
- Suggest commands; never execute them.
- Update this file after each major feature.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues (as of Nov 11, 2025)

1.  **Forgot Password Flow is Broken**: The password reset page (`/auth/reset-password`) gets stuck on "Verifying..." and never completes. This is due to a suspected deadlock/race-condition with the Supabase client library's automatic session recovery.
2.  **Google Account Linking is Unreliable**: Linking a Google account to an existing email account doesn't always behave as expected. It can sometimes link the wrong Google account if the user is already logged into Google in their browser.

---

## ✅ Recent Updates (Nov 25, 2025 - Route System Phase 1)

### 🛣️ **Route-Based Trip Planning - Phase 1 Backend COMPLETE**

#### 🎯 **Implementation Overview**

Phase 1 of the route-based trip planning system is complete. This provides the database and backend foundation for trip routes and activities.

**Database Changes (via Supabase MCP):**
- ✅ `trip_locations` table: stores ordered route waypoints per trip
  - Fields: id, trip_id, location_name, latitude, longitude, order_index, arrival_date, departure_date
  - Constraints: unique order per trip, order_index > 0, departure >= arrival
  - RLS: Members can CRUD locations on their trips
- ✅ `activities` table: stores activities linked to locations
  - Fields: id, trip_id, location_id (FK), type, title, notes, start_time, end_time, all_day, icon, color, created_by
  - RLS: Members can CRUD activities on their trips

**Backend Modules Created:**

`apps/backend/src/trip-locations/`:
- `trip-locations.module.ts` - NestJS module
- `trip-locations.service.ts` - Business logic (CRUD + reorder)
- `trip-locations.controller.ts` - REST endpoints
- `dto/` - CreateTripLocationDto, UpdateTripLocationDto, ReorderLocationsDto

`apps/backend/src/activities/`:
- `activities.module.ts` - NestJS module
- `activities.service.ts` - Business logic (CRUD + grouped)
- `activities.controller.ts` - REST endpoints
- `dto/` - CreateActivityDto, UpdateActivityDto

**Shared Types (`packages/core`):**
- ✅ TripLocationSchema, CreateTripLocationSchema, UpdateTripLocationSchema, ReorderLocationsSchema
- ✅ ActivitySchema, CreateActivitySchema, UpdateActivitySchema
- ✅ ActivityTypeEnum with 16 activity types

**API Endpoints:**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/trips/:tripId/locations` | Get all locations (route) |
| POST | `/trips/:tripId/locations` | Add location to route |
| GET | `/trips/:tripId/locations/:locationId` | Get single location |
| PUT | `/trips/:tripId/locations/:locationId` | Update location |
| DELETE | `/trips/:tripId/locations/:locationId` | Delete location |
| POST | `/trips/:tripId/locations/reorder` | Reorder all locations |
| GET | `/trips/:tripId/activities` | Get all activities |
| GET | `/trips/:tripId/activities/grouped` | Get activities by location |
| POST | `/trips/:tripId/activities` | Create activity |
| GET | `/trips/:tripId/activities/:activityId` | Get single activity |
| PUT | `/trips/:tripId/activities/:activityId` | Update activity |
| DELETE | `/trips/:tripId/activities/:activityId` | Delete activity |

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Route Builder UI (create `route-builder.tsx`, integrate into trip creation)
- Phase 3: Activity-Location Linking (timeline view, activity forms)
- Phase 4: Weather per location
- Phase 5: Maps visualization (Mapbox)

---

## ✅ Recent Updates (Current Session - Share Codes Implementation)

### 🔗 **Shareable Trip URLs with Share Codes - COMPLETE**

#### 🎯 **Implementation Overview**

- ✅ Trips now use short share codes (8 alphanumeric characters) instead of UUIDs for URLs
- ✅ URL format: `/trips/{shareCode}` (e.g., `/trips/AbC123Xy`) instead of `/trips/{uuid}`
- ✅ Share codes automatically generated when creating trips
- ✅ Backend generates unique share codes with collision checking
- ✅ Frontend navigation updated to use share codes throughout

**Backend Changes:**
- ✅ `generateShareCode()` utility function in `packages/core/src/utils/share-code.ts`
- ✅ Backend `createTrip` automatically generates unique share codes
- ✅ `GET /trips/share/:shareCode` endpoint for fetching trips by share code
- ✅ Share code validation and uniqueness enforcement

**Frontend Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `TripGrid` to navigate using `trip.share_code` instead of `trip.id`
- ✅ Updated all trip navigation handlers to use share codes
- ✅ `useTrip` hook accepts share code parameter
- ✅ All route references updated: `/trips/${shareCode}` format
- ✅ Edit page correctly uses share code for navigation, trip ID for API calls

**Build System:**
- ✅ Added `postinstall` script to automatically build `@gotrippin/core` package
- ✅ Added `build:core` script for manual builds
- ✅ Ensures core package is built after `npm install` (fixes TypeScript compilation errors)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/core/src/utils/share-code.ts` (new utility functions)
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` (export share code utilities)
- `apps/backend/src/supabase/supabase.service.ts` (share code generation in createTrip)
- `apps/backend/src/trips/trips.controller.ts` (share code endpoint)
- `apps/web/src/components/trips/trip-grid.tsx` (use share_code for navigation)
- `apps/web/src/components/trips/trips-list.tsx` (updated interface)
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` (use shareCode parameter)
- `apps/web/app/trips/page.tsx` (use shareCode parameter)
- `apps/web/app/trips/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (clarified share code usage)
- `package.json` (added postinstall and build:core scripts)
- `readme.md` (added share code documentation)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clean, shareable URLs that don't expose UUIDs
- ✅ Better UX with readable trip URLs
- ✅ Maintains security via RLS (users must be trip members)
- ✅ Automatic build ensures core package is always up-to-date

---

## ✅ Recent Updates (Nov 12, 2025 - Evening Session)

### 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes - COMPLETE**

#### **1. Date Clearing Bug in Edit Trip**

- **Issue**: When editing a trip, if a user cleared previously set dates, the API wouldn't receive the update because the conditions were never met
- **Fix**: Added explicit `null` value handling for cleared dates
- **Impact**: Users can now properly clear trip dates when editing

```typescript
// Before: dates would remain unchanged if cleared
if (data.dateRange?.from) { ... }

// After: explicitly send null to clear dates
else if (trip?.start_date) {
  tripData.start_date = null
}
```

#### **2. i18n Hydration Mismatch**

- **Issue**: Server rendered English text ("Loading...") but client detected Bulgarian ("Зареждане..."), causing hydration errors
- **Root Cause**: Language detection happens client-side, so server doesn't know which language to use
- **Fix**: Added `mounted` state to prevent rendering translations until after client hydration
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `apps/web/app/trips/create/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/trips/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

```typescript
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true)
}, [])

// Only render translations after hydration
{mounted && <p>{t('trips.loading')}</p>}
```

**Impact**:

- ✅ No more hydration warnings in console
- ✅ Smooth client-side rendering
- ✅ i18n works perfectly without React errors

---

- **trip_overview.\*** - 10 keys (itinerary, documents, guests, delete dialog, etc.)
- **background_picker.\*** - 7 keys (modal, search, attribution, etc.)
- **date_picker.\*** - 4 keys (title, buttons, selection)
- **recommended.\*** - 2 keys (title, subtitle)

**Components Updated with i18n:**

- ✅ `trip-overview.tsx` - All labels, buttons, and dialog text

## ✅ Recent Updates (Nov 12, 2025 - Early Session)

### ⚡ **Unsplash API Optimization - COMPLETE**

#### 🚀 **Performance Improvements**

- ✅ Removed unnecessary initial API request on app mount
- ✅ Images now load lazily only when background picker modal opens
- ✅ Increased debounce delay from 300ms to 500ms for better rate limiting
- ✅ Added check to prevent search when modal is closed
- ✅ Prevented redundant API calls when images are already loaded

**Impact:**

- **Before:** 1 API call on every page load + 1 per keystroke (300ms delay)
- **After:** 0 calls until user opens modal + 1 call every 500ms after typing stops
- **Result:** Saves hundreds of unnecessary API calls per session

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/hooks/useImageSearch.ts` (removed default query, optimized search trigger)
- `apps/web/src/components/trips/background-picker.tsx` (lazy loading, better debouncing)

**Why This Matters:**

- Reduces load on Unsplash API (staying under free tier limits)
- Faster app load times (no blocking network requests)
- Better user experience (no unnecessary loading states)
- Conserves backend cache resources
