# Later (Phase 6 / backlog)

Saved for when we prioritise public trip sharing.

- ☐ Per-trip visibility toggle — Private (auth required) vs Anyone with link (view without login)
- ☐ DB: add visibility field to trips
- ☐ NestJS: GET /trips/share/:shareCode returns public trips without auth
- ☐ Read-only layout — minimal UI for unauthenticated viewers (no DockBar, no edit, CTA to sign up)
- ☐ RLS: allow unauthenticated select for public trips
